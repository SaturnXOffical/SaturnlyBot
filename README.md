# SaturnlyBot
Open Sourced Discord Bot


Official code used for Saturnly.

Don't judge how I coded things. Most things will be changed (eg the command handler) for better organization.
This is my first ever attempt at a Discord bot, and basically an introduction for me to Discord.js and the API

Main problems with the bot will get fixed in V2


You can do whatever you want with this code, just please give credit. (@SaturnDev#3797)

I will not be giving how-to's on how to get a token and execute this code.
I don't suggest using this code as a newcomer, and instead just make it yourself.
