# Saturnly the Discord Bot

Made by @SaturnDev#3797



# General Code Information

Library: [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

GitHub (your here lmao)

[Support Server](https://discord.gg/wbP7YY5fXF)

# How to Use

I intend the bot to be used for scrapped of spare code for other [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) developers, and NOT for use of using as your own bot, as the license states (in short terms) that you can use the code to your intent and any errors is on you, and not me. Also stated that you cannot reupload modified versions of the code.



# Help & Issues

Join our [support server,](https://discord.gg/wbP7YY5fXF) and send a message and I'll help you as long as it doesn't violate the license.
